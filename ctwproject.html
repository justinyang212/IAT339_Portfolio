<div class="entirewriteup">
<p class="projectbody">Care To Wear is a mobile app prototype created in a third year UX and UI design course at Simon Fraser University. Care To Wear aims to track resource consumption based on the clothing you add to your wardrobe. My roles were UX and UI designer within a group of 6.<br><br>

We started the creation of this app by researching a potential domain where we can meaningfully intervene and create a useful product. After establishing our decided domain, which was the environmental impact of clothing, we began to consider the different stakeholders in this domain. We began conducting in person interviews with individuals who have an interest in this domain, and we published an online survey as well. Through this process, we met Cleo (Figure 1). I was largely in charge of the content in the persona, creating what her goals, motivations, and frustrations through synthesizing the data gathered from the interviews and survey we conducted with people that are similar to Cleo.</p>

  After gaining a general sense of who we want to design for and in what area, we began a rapid idea generation process. In this process, my team and I would write out as many ideas as we could, and then grouped ones that seemed similar or could complement each other. Afterwards, we began to discuss which ideas we would like to spend more time investigating, based on which one would best fit our persona and also which one seemed the most interesting for us to pursue.<br><br>

In the end, we selected an idea that I proposed, which aimed to design a digital application which provided the user a more tangible and statistic driven way in which they could measure their goals and progress in becoming more sustainable. After deciding on the concept, we began to create interaction wire flows using a collaborative interface design tool called Figma.<br><br>

As our idea progressed, my team and I assigned each other a different section within the app, becoming in charge of the interaction flow and interface design in our respective sections. I was in charge of the “Community” tab, which displayed various articles or videos relating to fashion sustainability (Figure 2). We went through various iterations of the layout and design of the UI after several rounds of user testing.

  A challenge that occured during the iterations of this app was when we were introduced to the idea of incorporating a social media aspect to the app during critique from our teaching assistant. Our teaching assistant explained how it would allow people like our persona become more engaged with environmentalism, and would also appeal to a younger audience. Although there were benefits to this, we did not want our app to become another social media platform which would create a sense of competition or comparison with others. The original idea of our app was not intended to become the "most enviromental friendly" but to encourage individiuals to become more conscious of their clothing consumption and focus on self improvement. We wanted the engagement that comes with social media platforms that allow you to publicly post or share, but we also wanted to ensure that our team stuck to our original intention and principles for this project.<br><br>

In the end, we decided to create a sharing option that would link to pre-existing social media platforms such as Snapchat or Instagram as we did like the idea of creating more engagement or incentive for a younger audience to continually use the app. We felt that this decision held a nice balance and compromise between both conflicting sides. In the end, I believe this added feature does make the app stronger by appealing more to a younger audience but also respects our design intentions and principles.<br><br>

Overall, our project was successfully completed and we believed we accomplished everything we set out to do. Care To Wear is an app that is intended to empower young invidivduals wanting to make a conscious change in their clothing consumption. The app provides tangible and concrete progression and feedback while also sharing tips and advice for individuals who might be lost about learning how to consume less.<br><br>
