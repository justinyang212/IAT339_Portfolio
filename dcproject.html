<div class="entirewriteup">
<p class="projectbody">
A major project that I worked on was in a second year spatial design course. The premise of this project was to design and create a small physical model of a form and create deck slides to accompany the form to be able to communicate your ideas effectively and concisely. Within a group of 5 other members, I primarily contributed to the graphic design and art direction of this project.

  Because this project was an extension of an earlier project (Figure 1), we were given feedback prior to the start of this project. When presenting our initial slides, we were told the slide design felt too safe and cliché by our professor. When designing our slides, key words used within the moodboard were “lightness” and “simplicity” to convey an overall elegant style in our slides. They challenged us to make our deck design more interesting, as the style we chose is ubiquitous in graphic design.

  I was attracted to the idea of “bold elegance”, which is the term I used to describe a different aesthetic that would retain a feeling of elegance within the design, but strayed away from the feminine and gentle qualities typically associated with elegance. However, I struggled a lot with finding a balance between boldness and elegance. Since they were so different from one another, it was difficult to create a cohesive style that combined the two. Fortunately, once I secured the colour scheme by establishing a new moodboard (Figure 2), designing the deck slide became easier.

  Everything was built upon the colour scheme. The inky blue contrasted well with the blush pink as the blue provided a more digital and serious feeling in contrast to the blush pink, which felt very effortless and natural. From then on, as a team, we began to create smaller graphic elements that played on the digital and tech driven aesthetic the blue naturally gave off to be able to contrast the feminine pink colour, as well as the feminine type we used in the slides (Figure 3). Through this project, my team and I were awarded first place out of 15 groups due to our acute attention to detail and consistently high quality across all components of the project.<br><br>
