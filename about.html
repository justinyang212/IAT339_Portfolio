  <p>My name is Justin Yang and I am a third year student at Simon Fraser University. I study Interactive Arts and Technology, primarily concentrating in Design. Being introduced to technology at a young age, I have always taken the convenience of technology for granted. Now, I am studying how thoughtfully designed and visually elegant digital tools are able to enrich the lives of all different kinds of people. Design has allowed me to exercise both my creative freedom as well as analytical thinking skills as design is where art and science intersect. Through the use of front-end software such as Adobe Illustrator, Figma, and ProtoPie, I design human-centred experiences that empower and encourage individuals.</p>
